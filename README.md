### 🚀 About Me

I'm a Ghana-based developer with 3+ years of experience crafting scalable software that solves real problems. For me, it’s not just about writing clean code - it’s about solving real problems that help people and businesses move forward.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me behind a piano or a bass guitar.
